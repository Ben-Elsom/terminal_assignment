# Software development plan

## Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:
- describe at a high level what the application will do

My game will be a text based dating game. 
The goal of the game will be to impress the girl/boy enough that when you ask to go on a date, they accepts.
To impress your partner you will have to have a conversation with them and respond to their questions with answers that they like. This will increase their “flirt” score and if this is pushed above 50 and then they are asked out on a date, they will say yes and you will win the game.
If you ask your date for their number and their flirt score is not high enough you will get rejected and lose the game.
When the game is started a random girl or boy (depending on the users preference) will be generated with random interests and will effect whether certain answers are worth more or less points. Answers that lean into the partners interests will be worth more points. 
At the start of the game the user will be allowed to designate a certain amount of skill points (the amount of skill points changes depending on the game difficulty) and will able to designate between the 3 skills of the game: strength, intelligence and charisma. These skills will be the difference between whether a response will have a positive or negative reaction
