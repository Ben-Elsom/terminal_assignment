# what to be able to prompt the user with a question 

# what to be able to get a response from them.

# want to be able to give a response from the date based on the selection the user made. 

# want to be able to add the score that response gives to the users flirt score 

# want to be able to ask the next question 

if i had a method i would need to pass in the response, the traits and the skill scores to know whether they passed or not. 

    a class could hold the traits and the skill score

    how would I pass in the response? hard code the question then get response, relate it to the response for it
