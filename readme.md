# Software development plan

## Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:
- describe at a high level what the application will do

My game will be a text based dating game. 
The goal of the game will be to impress the girl/boy enough that when you ask to go on a date, they accepts.
To impress your partner you will have to have a conversation with them and respond to their questions with answers that they like. This will increase their “flirt” score and if this is pushed above 50 and then they are asked out on a date, they will say yes and you will win the game.
 If you reach the end of the conversation and you have not asked them to go out on a date you will lose. 
If you ask for a date too prematurely you will get rejected and lose the game.
When the game is started a random girl or boy (depending on the users preference) will be generated with random interests and will affect the questions they ask and how much each answer will be worth. Answers that lean into the partners interests will be worth more points. 
You will also be given money that you can use to buy items that will increase your attributes and so increase the chance of certain options working. 


- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it

The problem that this game is solving is that during the covid era, many people are not able to go out to try and find a partner. By playing this game the user will be able to simulate dating without any risk. They will learn basic principles of dating in what to do and what not to do. My goal is to help the user gain confidence so that when bars are open the user can go back to the dating scene with increased knowledge on what to do.

- identify the target audience

The target audience is men and women aged 18-25. People who have not had much dating experience or none at all. People who may be anxious about the idea of talking to someone at a bar.  

- explain how a member of the target audience will use it

The member of the target audience will use this app by inputting predominantly numbers into the terminal reflecting a choice of an option. They will also be inputting words for some of the questions. They will be expected to remember the partners interests and name which will then effect the amount of points they will receive for certain questions later in the game.

## Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

1. Multiple choice questions effecting the ability to be able to take the partner home or not. (base game)

In the base game, you will be given a randomly generated name for your partner. The gender of the partner will be decided by the user at start up. The partner will then ask the user a number of usual fist date question and the user must decide what answer they think the partner would like best. The degree with which the partner likes the response will decide whether the users “flirt” score goes up or down and by how much. If they then ask the partner if they would like to go on a date then the program will check what the users score “flirt” score is and if it is above 50 the the partner will say yes and they will go out on a date. 

2. Choice of attributes at start up effecting whether player have the option to choose the best answers. 

At the start of the game the user will have the choice of how they would like to divvy up their skill points into the 4 skills: Luck, Intelligence, Strength, and Charisma. 
These skill points will effect the likelihood that certain speech options will go the users way. For example the user could try to kiss the partner but if their charisma isn’t very high they will have a low chance of this working and may reduce their “flirt” score, whereas if they have a high charisma it has a greater chance of working and then greatly increasing their flirt score. 


3. Change in the partners interests for each new game which effects the amount of points some options will give the user.

At load up the user will have a partner generated who will have a random name and will also have a number of random interests, there will be speech options that will be worth more if the partner is interested in that thing. It will be on the user to remember what the partners interests were so that they can tailor their responses to the specific partner. 

4. Use of money to buy drinks to alter stats or to buy partner drink and increase flirt score directly. 

At load up the user will be given $30 that they can use in a number of ways. Buy drinks for themselves or by drinks for their partner. 
If they buy a drink for themselves it will increase their charisma buy 2 but reduce their intelligence by 1
If they buy a drink for their partner it will increase their flirt score. 



## Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user



## Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.


## Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.


## Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
